# [Eat-Da-Burger](https://lamontblack1.github.io/homeworkNodeMysqlBurgerApp/)

This is my first fully deployed app with the database server side. The great majority of it was coded by typing from scratch.

# Why this project is useful
This is useful because the code demonstrates use of mysql server server-side. It also uses a controller and ORM structure to administer queries and receive responses and render these using handlebars to the user. While this application makes limited use of these technologies, it shows the nearly unlimited potential and flexibility that could be exploited. It also teaches in-depth understanding of callback functions.
